## Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
	- What is recursion
	- How to implement recursion
	- In what situations you should implement recursion
	- In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
### [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c)
	``` 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget ```

* Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

	- Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
* FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more
